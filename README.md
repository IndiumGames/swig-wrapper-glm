SWIG wrapper for GLM
====================

This is a SWIG wrapper for OpenGL Mathematics (GLM).

It allows you to use [GLM](http://glm.g-truc.net/) from within the [languages supported by SWIG](http://swig.org/compat.html#SupportedLanguages) (so far we've only tested Lua, because that's what we use in [HactEngine](http://indiumgames.fi/#hactengine)).

This wrapper is open source and distributed under the MIT license.


SWIG
----

[SWIG](http://swig.org/) (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator) is an open source tool for generating wrapper code.

It allows you to wrap C or C++ programs or libraries so that they can be used in various programming languages, like Lua, Python, Java and many others.


GLM
---

[GLM](http://glm.g-truc.net/) (OpenGL Mathematics) is an open source mathematics library, based on the syntax and functionality of GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language).

GLM is mostly used for games and other software that uses OpenGL, but it can be used for any software which needs vector and matrix calculations.


Usage
-----

To use the wrapper, you need SWIG and GLM.

**NOTE:**  
You need to use a slightly modified version of GLM's source code.  
You can use the `swig` branch from this repository: https://github.com/IndiumGames/glm

SWIG has compiled binaries for most operating systems, see their [download page](http://swig.org/download.html) for instructions. GLM is a header only binary, which is compiled along with the code generated by SWIG. You can [download GLM here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ogl-math/files/).

To generate the wrapper, run a command like the following:  
```bash
swig -c++ -lua -v -I<path_to_GLM> swig_glm.i
```

Replace ```-lua``` with the language you want to generate wrappers for (see SWIG's documentation for the [available languages](http://swig.org/compat.html#SupportedLanguages)).

If you have GLM in your include path, you can omit the ```-I<path_to_GLM>``` parameter.

This should result in a generated file named ```swig_glm_wrap.cxx```. Compile this and link it with your application ([see SWIG usage examples](http://www.swig.org/Doc3.0/SWIGDocumentation.html#Introduction_nn4)).
